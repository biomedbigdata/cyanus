Data from human platelets of patients with chronic coronary syndrome undergoing different therapy: dual antiplatelet therapy versus triple antiplatelet therapy, before and after platelet activation with 10Âµm TRAP. There are files of 7 patients with triple therapy and 12 patients with dual therapy (each in two condtions).

# 1. Data Upload
Fcs files, as well as metadata and a panel file are given for this dataset and uploaded in this section. You just have to specify the path to your files. The Single Cell Experiment is then created using the prepData function of CATALYST. The function prepData can directly transform the marker intesities using arcsinh (inverse hyerpoblic sine) to make the distributions more symmetric and to map them to a comparable range of expression. Recommended values for the cofactor parameter are 5 for mass cytometry (CyTOF) or 150 for fluorescence flow cytometry.

```{r uploadFiles, eval=FALSE}
path <- "/Users/lisiarend/Desktop/Uni/Master/SysBioMed/CyTOF/extdata/HumanPlatelets"
cofactor <- 5
exp <-list.files(path,pattern = "\\.fcs$",full.names = T)#[1:14]
names <- list.files(path,pattern = "*.fcs")#[1:14]
samples <-sapply(names, function(x) {
    strsplit(x, split = ".fcs")[[1]]
  })
patients <-sapply(names, function(x) {
    str_sub(strsplit(x, split = "_")[[1]][1], end = -2)
  })
a_b <- sapply(names, function(x) {
    str_sub(strsplit(x, split = "_")[[1]][1], start = 8)
  })
dual_triple <-
  sapply(names, function(x) {
    strsplit(strsplit(x, split = "_")[[1]][2], split = ".fcs")[[1]][1]
  })
metadata <- data.table(
  "file_name" = names,
  "sample_id" = samples,
  "patient_id" = patients,
  "activated_baseline" = a_b,
  "dual_triple" = dual_triple
)
panel <-read_excel(paste0(path,"panel_platelets.xlsx"))
sce <-
  prepData(
    exp,
    panel,
    metadata,
    transform = TRUE,
    cofactor = cofactor,
    md_cols = list(
      file = "file_name",
      id = "sample_id",
      factors = c("activated_baseline", "dual_triple","patient_id")
    )
  )
```

Otherwise, you can load the "sce_transformed.rds" file which already contains the transformed SingleCellExperiment.
```{r uploadSCE}
path_to_rds <- "/nfs/home/students/ga89koc/hiwi/cytof/data/platelets/sce_transformed.rds"
sce <- readRDS(path_to_rds)
```

# Quality Control

The shiny app includes some simple visualization plots to verify whether the data represents what we expect, for example, whether samples that are replicates of one condition are more similar and are distinct from samples from another condition. Depending on the situation, one can then consider removing problematic markers or samples from further analysis.

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
CATALYST::plotCounts(
    sce,
    group_by = "patient_id", # possible inputs: names(colData(sce))
    color_by = "dual_triple", # possible inputs: names(colData(sce))
    prop = FALSE # TRUE for stacked relative abundances, FALSE for total cell counts
  ) 

CATALYST::pbMDS(
      sce,
      label_by = "patient_id", 
      color_by = "activated_baseline",
      features = NULL, # possible inputs: unique(rowData(sce)$marker_class) or NULL (to use all features)
      assay = "exprs", # possible inputs: assayNames(sce)
    ) + theme(text = element_text(size=18))

CATALYST::plotNRS(
      sce,
      color_by = "activated_baseline",
      features = NULL,
      assay = "exprs"
    )

plotExprHeatmap(
      sce,
      features = NULL,
      assay = "exprs"
    )
```

These plots can then be used to select patients and filter the Single Cell Experiment. As one can see, the number of cells in patient RPS124 is notably lower than in the other patients. 

Additionally, the multidimensional scaling plot shows which samples cluster well within the same condition. On the first dimension, one can see that the two conditions activated and baseline are reasonably well separated. However, there are some outlier samples detected. Samples A and B of patient 108 and patient 99 are very similar and can't be clearly separated into two conditions. Taking into account the second dimension, which represents the dissimilarities between patients, we can see that patient 124 is very far away of the other samples and should thus be excluded for further analysis.

The expression heatmap agrees with our observations. In addition to patient 124, 108 and 99, one should take into account to exclude patient 149 because of its A sample. The sample 149_A shows are strang expression over all markers and is added in the hierarchical clustering at a very high distance. This concludes that sample 149_A is very dissimilar to the others. 

In our workflow, we perform FlowSOM and ConsensusClusterPlus because they appeared amongst the fastest and best performing clustering approaches in recent studies. 
```{r}
sce <- clusterSCE(sce)
delta_area(sce)

```

The delta area represents the amount of extra cluster stability gained when clustering into k groups as compared to k-1 groups. The "natural" number of clusters present in the data should thus corresponds to the value of k where there is no longer a considerable increase in stability (plateau onset).

We have chosen meta7, because at meta7 the plateau is reached and the proportions of cells in the clusters are not too small.

Let's have a look at the clusters:
```{r}
CATALYST::plotAbundances(sce, "meta7", group_by = "activated_baseline") +  theme(text = element_text(size=18), axis.text.x = element_text(size=12)) 
```

As we can see above, some patients have odd clusters. Further investigation might be necessary to uncover the reasons for that. For now we will exclude the patients RPS108, RPS096, RPS149, RPS124 and RPS099 from the analysis. Hence, we will repeat the clustering step:

```{r}
sce <- makePatientSelection(sce = sce, deselected_patients = c("RPS 108", "RPS 096", "RPS 149", "RPS 124", "RPS 099"))
sce <- clusterSCE(sce)
delta_area(sce)
```

Let's have a look at the clusters of meta7:
```{r}
CATALYST::plotAbundances(sce, "meta7", group_by = "activated_baseline") +  theme(text = element_text(size=18), axis.text.x = element_text(size=12)) 

CATALYST::plotAbundances(sce, "meta7", by = "cluster_id", shape_by = "patient_id", group_by = "activated_baseline")

invisible(plotStarsCustom(sce, backgroundValues = cluster_codes(sce)[["meta7"]]))

CATALYST::plotClusterExprs(sce, "meta7") +  theme(text = element_text(size=18)) 

CATALYST::plotFreqHeatmap(sce, "meta7")
```
After filtering, the deviations in the relative population abundances for meta7 are removed. Taking a deeper look into the smoothed densities of marker intensities by cluster, we can see which markers are responsible for the individual clusters. The red densities represent marker expression for cells in a given cluster. And the blue densities are calculated over all the cells and serve as a reference.

Comparing for example, cluster 5 and 7 (so the second and third red densities), we can see that CD42B is responsible for the partition of both clusters. If we would now reduce 7 clustersto meta6, the small clusters would remain and bigger clusters like cluster 2 and 3 would get merged together because they are more similar. 


```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
DR_methods <- c("UMAP","PCA")

for( method in DR_methods ){
  print(method)
  sce <- runDimRed(sce, method, cells_chosen = 1000, feature_chosen = "type", assay_chosen = "exprs", scale = T, k = 3)
}


for( method in DR_methods ){
  g <- CATALYST::plotDR(sce, dr = method, color_by = "meta6") +  theme(text = element_text(size=18))
  print(g)
}
```

Finally, the quality control of the data is completed and data is ready for further analysis. 


# 2. Activated vs. Baseline
First, we are going to compare activated vs. baseline platelets in dual and in triple patients. First, we are going to take a look at the state markers in the activated and baseline platelets. 

```{r}
CATALYST::plotExprs(
      sce,
      color_by = "activated_baseline",
      features = "state",
      assay = "exprs"
    )  + theme(text = element_text(size=18))


DR_methods <- c("UMAP","PCA")

for( method in DR_methods ){
  print(method)
  sce <- runDimRed(sce, method, cells_chosen = 1000, feature_chosen = "type", assay_chosen = "exprs", scale = T, k = 3)
}

state_markers <- rowData(sce)[rowData(sce)$marker_class=="state",]$marker_name
for( method in DR_methods ){
  g <- CATALYST::plotDR(sce, dr = method, color_by = state_markers, facet_by="activated_baseline") +  theme(text = element_text(size=18))
  print(g)
}

for( method in DR_methods ){
  print(method)
  sce <- runDimRed(sce, method, cells_chosen = 1000, feature_chosen = "state", assay_chosen = "exprs", scale = T, k = 3)
}

for( method in DR_methods ){
  g <- CATALYST::plotDR(sce, dr = method, color_by = "activated_baseline", facet_by="dual_triple") +  theme(text = element_text(size=18))
  print(g)
}
```
The state markers shown in the plots are the activation markers of platelets and are known to be differently expressed in activated and baseline samples. The markers CD63 and CD620 are higher expressed in A than in B samples. Markers CD107a and CD154 are much lower expressed than the other two, but however one can see a small difference between both conditions. 

Let's move on to the comparison of activated/baseline in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy.

## 2.1 Dual Activated vs. Dual Baseline
First, we have to filter the data to only have dual patients.
```{r}
sce_d <- filterSCE(sce, dual_triple == "dual")

# set none markers to state in order to be able to include them in the analysis (for LMM and limma)
rowData(sce_d)$marker_class <- rowData(sce_d)$marker_class[rowData(sce_d)$marker_class == "none"] <- "state"
```

Before performing the differential marker expression analysis, the median marker expressions are plotted.
```{r,fig.with=12, fig.height=8}
CATALYST::plotPbExprs(sce_d, k = "all", features = NULL , color_by = "activated_baseline",  ncol=8, facet_by = "antigen") +  theme(text = element_text(size=16))
```
Comparing both conditions in dual patients, the state markers CD62P and CD63 show highest difference in median marker expression between A and B. Additionally, one could expect to find a significance for the PEAR marker. Taking a brief look at the other two state markers, CD107a and CD154, the median is not the right way to plot them because they are very high zero inflated. 

Finally, the differential analysis can be performed using the linear mixed effect models of CATALYST.
```{r,fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
res_d <- runDS(sce = sce_d,
      condition = "activated_baseline",
      de_methods = c("LMM"),
      k = "all",
      features = "all",
      markers_to_test = "all",
      random_effect = "patient_id"
      )

CATALYST::plotDiffHeatmap(sce_d, rowData(res_d$LMM$res), all=T, col_anno = c("activated_baseline", "patient_id"), normalize = TRUE)
```
Running the linear mixed model with taking into account the patient id as random affect, the model sees 7 significant markers between dual activated and dual baseline. Some of them are type markers which are interesting for further investigation.


## 2.2 Triple Activated vs. Triple Baseline
Comparing now activated vs. baseline in triple patients:
```{r,fig.with=12, fig.height=8}
sce_t <- filterSCE(sce, dual_triple == "triple")
# set none markers to state in order to be able to include them in the analysis (for LMM and limma)
rowData(sce_t)$marker_class <- rowData(sce_t)$marker_class[rowData(sce_t)$marker_class == "none"] <- "state"

CATALYST::plotPbExprs(sce_t, k = "all", features = NULL , color_by = "activated_baseline",  ncol=8, facet_by = "antigen") +  theme(text = element_text(size=16))

res_t <- runDS(sce = sce_t,
      condition = "activated_baseline",
      de_methods = c("LMM"),
      k = "all",
      features = "all",
      random_effect = "patient_id"
      )

CATALYST::plotDiffHeatmap(sce_t, rowData(res_t$LMM$res), all=T, col_anno = c("activated_baseline", "patient_id"), normalize = TRUE)
```
Performing the same analysis on the triple patients, we can again recognize both state markers to have highest difference between A and B. The linear mixed effect model found in the triple patients little less significant markers. 


# 3. Dual vs. Triple
Finally, we should analyze the difference of dual and triple therapy.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
DR_methods <- c("UMAP","PCA")

for( method in DR_methods ){
  print(method)
  sce <- runDimRed(sce, method, cells_chosen = 1000, feature_chosen = "type", assay_chosen = "exprs", scale = T, k = 3)
}

for( method in DR_methods ){
  g <- CATALYST::plotDR(sce, dr = method, color_by = "dual_triple", facet_by="activated_baseline") +  theme(text = element_text(size=18))
  print(g)
}
```
This UMAP and PCA show that the cells can't get clustered very well for dual and triple patients.

## 3.1 Dual Activated vs. Triple Activated
First, we have to filter the patients for only activated samples.
```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
sce_a <- filterSCE(sce, activated_baseline == "A")
rowData(sce_a)$marker_class <- rowData(sce_a)$marker_class[rowData(sce_a)$marker_class == "none"] <- "state"

CATALYST::plotPbExprs(sce_a, k = "all", features = NULL , color_by = "dual_triple",  ncol=8, facet_by = "antigen") +  theme(text = element_text(size=16))

res_a <- runDS(sce = sce_a,
      condition = "dual_triple",
      de_methods = c("LMM"),
      k = "all",
      features = "all"
      )

CATALYST::plotDiffHeatmap(sce_a, rowData(res_a$LMM$res), all=T, col_anno = c("dual_triple"), normalize = TRUE)
```

## 3.2 Dual Baseline vs. Triple Basleline
```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
sce_b <- filterSCE(sce, activated_baseline == "B")
rowData(sce_b)$marker_class <- rowData(sce_b)$marker_class[rowData(sce_b)$marker_class == "none"] <- "state"

CATALYST::plotPbExprs(sce_b, k = "all", features = NULL , color_by = "dual_triple",  ncol=8, facet_by = "antigen") +  theme(text = element_text(size=16))

res_b <- runDS(sce = sce_b,
      condition = "dual_triple",
      de_methods = c("LMM"),
      k = "all",
      features = "all",
      )

CATALYST::plotDiffHeatmap(sce_b, rowData(res_b$LMM$res), all=T, col_anno = c("dual_triple"), normalize = TRUE)
```

We could not find any significant markers for activated platelets in dual and triple as well as for the baseline platelets. This means that we cannot see any biological change in dual and triple therapy. So the third anticoagulant doesnât seem to have any effect on the marker expression.

# 4. Conclusion
+ Activated and baseline platelet show significant differences in dual and triple patients:
    + state markers (control): CD62P, CD63
    + other markers: PAR1, CD42a, PEAR (dual), CD69 (dual), CD45 (dual), CD40 (triple)
+ No significant differences for dual vs. triple anticoagulation therapy
+ Outlook:
    + examine subgroups of platelets and define platelet subpopulations
    + pool therapies in further analysis
    
# 5. Quick Overview of the Functions of the Significant Markers
+ CD63 -> platelet activation marker 
+ CD62P -> platelet activation marker & platelet-leukocyte interactions
+ CD42a -> platelet leukocyte interactions & platelet aggregation (subunit of Van Willibrand factor) â interaction of GPIb-IX-V with VWF initiates platelet adhesion 
+ PEAR -> platelet aggregation
+ PAR1 -> thrombin receptor â platelet activation processes surprisingly low expressed in A samples probably too high dose of TRAP â PAR4 more involved in platelet activation
+ CD69 -> signal transmitter receptor in platelets & involved in platelet activation processes
+ CD45 -> leukocyte type marker â to certain extend also in platelets
+ CD40 -> receptor for state marker CD154 â probably no correlation (too low expressed)
