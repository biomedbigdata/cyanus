**This README was made to check the data and make an example workflow. To run the shiny app use** `shiny::runApp()`.

We are using renv with this project. You can load the library version from the lockfile using the `restore` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages('renv')
renv::restore()
```
